# Stacks and Queues
Implement and Stack and Queue data structure by creating a Node, Stack and Queue class.

## Challenge
I have to create a Stack class with a pop, push, and peek method that follows FILO order and test it. I also have to create a Queue class that has a FIFO order and has an enqueue, dequeue, and peek methods. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I'll follow pretty  closely the methods I used for linked list but will have to change how new nodes are added in order to for them to have the right order.
