# First-in, First out Animal Shelter
Implement an queue that takes into account two different types of animals

## Challenge
I will need to make sure that I can enqueue cats and dogs but make sure that dequeueing takes into account if I'm looking for a dog or a cat

## Approach & Efficiency
Since I already have a queue class I will be using it to create a queue class for both cats and dogs. I'll use if statements to both put them in the right queue and to dequeue the right ones in the order they are asked for
