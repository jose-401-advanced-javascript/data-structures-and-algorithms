# Singly Linked List
Write a new method that takes a value, counts backwards form the end a number of times equal to the value and outputs the value of the node.

## Challenge
You have to not only keep track of the total number of nodes but make sure that you're counting form the last node in the list.

## Approach & Efficiency
I'll have to add a way to keep track of the size of the total list which means not only creating a new method but also changing existing ones. I'll also keep track of the right now by counting the total number of nodes, subtracting the inputted value and then iterating through the nodes.
