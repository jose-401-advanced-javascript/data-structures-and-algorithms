# Singly Linked List
Write three new methods that add values to the end, and middle of the list based on the value of the node

## Challenge
You have to figure out a way to find the value that's right and then write code that will add a new node to the information that's already there without deleting any of the preexisting nodes. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I realized as I was reading the instructions of the append method that I had already solved that during the last code challenge and had not written a true inset method (i.e. my 'insert' method appends a new node to the end of the list and vice versa). So instated I wrote a true insert method and called it append. I also wanted to make things a simple as possible so I used my existing append method when possible.
