# Singly Linked List
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure with a Node and LinkedList Class

## Challenge
Write a LinkedList class that includes nodes that point to each other. We also have to include a method to insert new nodes, check to see if it includes a built node and can create a sting with all the node names.

## Approach & Efficiency
I will use classes for both Node and Linked list so that navigating through them can be kept time performance at O(1). Since we don't need to keep track of the size of the linked list I will only include a head as part of the constructor function.
