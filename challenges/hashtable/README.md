# Hashtables
Implement a hashtable with the add, get, contains, and hash methods. 

## Challenge
Research hashtable implementation and create one that can with the requested methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
I followed pretty closely the examples we white-boarded in the classroom and did some research on how to implement the contains method successfully.

## API
Methods:
- add: takes in both key and value and adds the key value pair to the table.
- get: takes in a key and returns the value stored in the table.
- contains: takes in a key and checks to see if the key exists on the table.
- hash: takes in a key and returns an index in the collection.
