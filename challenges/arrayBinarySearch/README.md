# Binary Search
We have to search through a sorter array for a number without using any of the built in search methods. 

## Challenge Description
I have to sort through the array in way that doesn't compare each individual element in the array but jumps around based on the fact that the items are sorted from smallest to largest. I also have to make sure I'm returning something if the number is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
I think the best way to do this would be to use a while loop that will verify that I have numbers left after I check the corresponding half of the search. This will allow me to keep track of if the number is in the array at all.
