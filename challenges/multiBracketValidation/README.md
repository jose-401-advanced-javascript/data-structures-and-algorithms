# Queues with Stacks
Implement a function that will iterate through a string an check to make sure that all brackets are closed.

## Challenge
Make sure to count all instances of the brackets and make sure they are all paired.

## Approach & Efficiency
We can iterate through string like an array with a for loop and compare each instance of a closing and opening bracket once we count both we can make sure to see if they balance out and return true if they do or false if they don't.
