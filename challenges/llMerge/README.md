# Challenge Summary
Write a function that take to lists and merges then into one.

## Challenge Description
The new list has to alternate between the two lists and place the nodes in the right order. It also has to be able to take lists of different sizes.

## Approach & Efficiency
I tried to make sure to use as many as the built in methods as possible. In order to keep an O(n) I kept the looping to a single while loop.
