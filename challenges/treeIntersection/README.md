# Tree Intersection
Crate a function that takes two trees and returns the values shared between them.

## Challenge
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
I'll use the built in preOrder method to navigate through the values in each tree.
