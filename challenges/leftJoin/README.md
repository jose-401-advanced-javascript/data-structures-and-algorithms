# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

## Challenge
The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values. The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values. Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.

## Approach & Efficiency
The easiest way to do it would be to use nested for loops but I want to try to use the least amount of iterating as possible to keep the code as effective as possible.
